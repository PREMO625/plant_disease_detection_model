Plant Disease Detection is an innovative machine learning project that harnesses the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deep learning techniques to identify and classify diseases in plants.

The dataset used in this project is the "New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)", downloaded from Kaggle. It contains images of various plant diseases and healthy leaves, categorized into 38 different classes. The dataset has been pre-augmented, meaning transformations like rotation, flipping, and zooming were applied beforehand to increase its diversity.
